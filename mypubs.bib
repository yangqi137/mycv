abstract = {We describe fluctuating two-dimensional metallic antiferromagnets by transforming to a rotating reference frame in which the electron spin polarization is measured by its projections along the local antiferromagnetic order. This leads to a gauge-theoretic description of an `algebraic charge liquid' involving spinless fermions and a spin S=1/2 complex scalar. We propose a phenomenological effective lattice Hamiltonian which describes the binding of these particles into gauge-neutral, electron-like excitations, and describe its implications for the electron spectral function across the entire Brillouin zone. We discuss connections of our results to photoemission experiments in the pseudogap regime of the cuprate superconductors.},

abstract = {The fate of a hole injected in an antiferromagnet is an outstanding issue of strongly correlated physics. It provides important insights into doped Mott insulators closely related to high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we report a systematic numerical study of t-J ladder systems based on the density matrix renormalization group. It reveals a surprising result for the single hole's motion in an otherwise well-understood undoped system. Specifically, we find that the common belief of quasiparticle picture is invalidated by the self-localization of the doped hole. In contrast to Anderson localization caused by disorders, the charge localization discovered here is an entirely new phenomenon purely of strong correlation origin. It results from destructive quantum interference of novel signs picked up by the hole, and since the same effect is of a generic feature of doped Mott physics, our findings unveil a new paradigm which may go beyond the single hole doped system.},

We show that if such a chiral spin liquid is realized in a two-dimensional lattice model with odd number of spin-$\frac12$ per unit cell and the state preserves spin rotation symmetry and translation symmetries, the semion excitation must carry both half-integer spin and fractional crystal quantum numbers. As a result, only a unique symmetry enriched topological phase can be realized in chiral spin liquids in a spin-$\frac12$ kagome lattice model.

We generalize this theory to an arbitrary band structure and ordering wave vector. The transition to the large Fermi-surface state, without pockets induced by local spin density wave order, is described by embedding the U(1) gauge theory in a SU(2) gauge theory. The phase diagram of the SU(2) gauge theory shows that the onset of spin density wave order in the Fermi liquid occurs either directly, in the framework discussed by Hertz, or via intermediate non-Fermi-liquid phases with Fermi surfaces of fractionalized excitations.

We show that such a phase transition can be realized through two steps: First bring the N\'eel state to the U(1) deconfined quantum critical point, which has been studied in the context of N\'eel -- valence bond solid (VBS) state phase transition. Then condense the spinon pair -- skyrmion/antiskyrmion bound state, which carries both gauge charge and flux of the U(1) gauge field emerging at the deconfined quantum critical point. We also propose a Schwinger boson projective wavefunction to realize such a Z_2 spin liquid state and find that it has a a relatively low variational energy(0.4893J1/site) for the J1-J2 model at J2=0.5J1. The spin liquid state we obtain breaks the four-fold rotational symmetry of square lattice and therefore is a nematic spin liquid state.},

abstract = {Based on three general guiding principles, i.e., no double occupancy constraint, accurate description of antiferromagnetism at half-filling, and the precise sign structure of the $t$-$J$ model, a new ground state wave function has been constructed recently [Weng, New J. Phys. 13, 103039 (2011)]. In this paper, we specifically study such kind of variational ground state for the one-hole-doped anisotropic two-leg $t$-$J$ ladder using variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. The results are then systematically compared with those recently obtained by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation. An excellent agreement is found between the VMC and DMRG results, including a "quantum critical point" at the anisotropy parameter $\alpha=\alpha_c\approx0.7$ (with the parameters $t/J=3$), and the emergence of charge modulation and momentum (Fermi point) reconstruction at $\alpha>\alpha_c$ due to the quantum interference of the sign structure. In particular, the wave function indicates that a Landau's quasiparticle description remains valid at $\alpha<\alpha_c$ but fails at $\alpha>\alpha_c$ due to the breakdown of the one-to-one correspondence of momentum and translational symmetry of the hole. The explicit form of the wave function provides a direct understanding on how the many-body strong correlation effect takes place non-perturbatively in a doped Mott insulator, which sheds interesting light on the two-dimensional case where the same type of wave function was proposed to describe the cuprate superconductor.},

All of these compounds undergo transitions to metallic and/or superconducting states under moderate hydrostatic pressure. We describe the Mott insulator using its hypothetical proximity to a Z2 spin liquid of bosonic spinons. This spin liquid has quantum phase transitions to descendant confining states with N{\'{e}}el or valence bond solid order, and the insulator can be on either side of one of these transitions. We present a theory of fermionic charged excitations in these states and describe the route to metallic states with Fermi surfaces. We argue that an excitonic condensate can form near this insulator-metal transition due to the formation of charge neutral pairs of charge +e and charge −e fermions. This condensate breaks the lattice space group symmetry, and we propose its onset as an explanation of a low temperature anomaly in $\kappa$-(ET)2Cu2(CN)3. We also describe the separate BCS instability of the metallic states to the pairing of like-charge fermions and the onset of superconductivity.},

abstract = {Charge order appears to be an ubiquitous phenomenon in doped Mott insulators, which is currently under intense experimental and theoretical investigations particularly in the high $T_c$ cuprates. This phenomenon is conventionally understood in terms of Hartree-Fock type mean field theory. Here we demonstrate a new mechanism for charge modulation which is rooted in the many-particle quantum physics arising in the strong coupling limit. Specifically, we consider the problem of a single hole in a bipartite $t-J$ ladder. As a remnant of the fermion signs, the hopping hole picks up subtle phases pending the fluctuating spins, the so-called phase string effect. We demonstrate the presence of charge modulations in the density matrix renormalization group solutions which disappear when the phase strings are switched off. This new form of charge modulation can be understood analytically in a path-integral language, showing that the phase strings give rise to constructive interferences leading to self-localization. When the latter occurs, left- and right-moving propagating modes emerge inside the localization volume and their interference is responsible for the real space charge modulation.},

Besides 8 states constructed in Schwinger-boson parton wavefunctions, 12 more states can be realized in Abrikosov-fermion parton construction. Within a larger gauge group than SU(2), the rest 44 states are also found in a spin-3/2 system. Among 20 types of Abrikosov-fermion Gutzwillerprojected wavefunctions, No.B5 state is a promising candidate for the $Z_{2}$ spin liquid for $J_{1}-J_{2}$ spin model on the triangular lattice. No.B5 lies close to Dirac spin liquid (DSL). However, variational Monte Carlo simulation find that DSL has a good variational energy and $J_{1}-J_{2}$ spin model cannot open a gap for spinons on top of DSL to stabilize No.B5 state.},

@article{QiEPMP,
abstract = {The surface of a three-dimensional topological electron system often hosts symmetry-protected gapless surface states. With the effect of electron interactions, these surface states can be gapped out without symmetry breaking by a surface topological order, in which the anyon excitations carry anomalous symmetry fractionalization that cannot be realized in a genuine two-dimensional system. We show that for a mirror-symmetry-protected topological crystalline insulator with mirror Chern number $n=4$, its surface can be gapped out by an anomalous $\mathbb Z_2$ topological order, where all anyons carry mirror-symmetry fractionalization $M^2=-1$. The identification of such anomalous crystalline symmetry fractionalization implies that in a two-dimensional $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid the vison excitation cannot carry $M^2=-1$ if the spinon carries $M^2=-1$ or a half-integer spin.},
